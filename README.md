# Ty the Tasmanian Tiger Mod Manager

## Setup

To get started using the Ty Mod Manager, simply head to the [releases page](http://github.com/xMcacutt/ty1_mod_manager/releases) and download the most recent mod manager zip.

Extract the zip anywhere and run the executable. On your first time loading the mod manager, you'll be asked if you would like to automatically set up a directory for your modded Ty. If yes, you should select your vanilla Ty directory (usually steamapps/common/Ty the Tasmanian Tiger). If no, you should go to the settings tab to set the directory manually.

## Codes

The codes tab allows you to have global pieces of code modifying the game across mods. To add codes to the list, make a pull request on github to the [codes.json](http://github.com/xMcacutt/ty1_mod_manager/blob/master/resource/codes.json) file.

## Installing Mods

To install a mod, first check the `mod directory` page in the mod manager. If you cannot find the mod in the directory, you might need to install it manually. Find and download the mod's zip file and select it from the `add custom` button on the `my mods` page.

## Adding Mods

`FOR MOD DEVELOPERS ONLY`

If you wish to add a mod you've created to this project, you'll need to reformat your release structure.

A mod is defined as a combination of a patch file and/or dll file. The patch file is used to modify the files belonging to the game and the dll file is used to modify the behaviour of the game. 

### Mod Info

Mods require a `mod_info.json` file which defines the information displayed in the mod directory on each listing.

Below is a list of the fields which should be defined in the json.

| `last_updated` | The date of last update. This should be kept in YYYY-MM-DD format. Please stick to this format and update with the mod                                                                                                                          | Yes       |

#### Dependencies

Dependencies come in two forms. Internal dependencies are dependencies required for functions specific to the mod. These dependecies can be added to a Dependencies directory in the mod zip.

External dependencies should be used when the dependency may apply to multiple mods. These dlls can be added to your mod_info as long as they can be downloaded from a link you provide. The following properties must be defined on all dependency objects

Note that internal dependencies do not need specifying in mod_info.json

| Property   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dep_name` | The name of the dll dependency without the extension                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `dep_ver`  | The version of the dependency required. This must use semantic versioning. Note that if two mods use the same dependency with different version references, the most recent version will be used. This may create conflicts. |
| `dep_url`  | A direct download link to the dependency                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Example mod_info.json

```json
{
  "name": "Collectible Tracker",
  "dll_name": "Ty Collectible Tracker Plugin",
  "description": "Tool to view current and total collectible counts overlaid onto the game.",
  "version": "1.1.1",
  "website": "",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "dep_name": "TygerMemory",
      "dep_version": "1.0.3",
      "dep_url": "https://github.com/xMcacutt/TygerMemory1/releases/download/1.0.3/TygerMemory.dll"
    }
  ],
  "conflicts": [
    "Archipelago Client",
    "Tyger Utility"
  ],
  "author": "xMcacutt",
  "download_url": "https://github.com/xMcacutt/Ty-Collectible-Tracker-Plugin/releases/latest/Ty.Collectible.Tracker.Plugin.zip",
  "last_updated": "2025-03-02"
}
```

### The Mod Directory

Once the `mod_info.json` file has been created, you'll need to upload it preferably as a a part of your mod's repository and add it to [mod_directory.json](http://github.com/xMcacutt/ty1_mod_manager/blob/master/mod_directory.json). You should create a pull request and add a name for your mod as well as the raw link to the mod_info file you uploaded. When the mod_directory is accessed in the mod manager, the mod_directory.json file will be accessed to look up each mod's mod_info before creating the listings based on the information you provide. Please ensure your json is valid before creating a pull request.

### Releasing Your Mods

When creating a release on github or any file host, you'll need to provide the mod as a zip file. The zip file should contain the `mod_info.json` file you should already have created; either a `Patch_PC.rkv` file or a `dll` file for you mod or both; and a `favico.ico` file which is used when displaying the mod in the installed mods list. If no `favico.ico` file is added, the `icon_url` from `mod_info.json` will be used instead;

These files will be extracted to the AppData/Roaming/io.mcacutt/mods directory upon installation.
